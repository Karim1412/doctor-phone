I am stronger than Death itself. I walk through the halls and my presence - MY DEMONIC DIVINE PRESENCE - pushes back the reaper. I am both destroyer and savior. The ultimate paradox.</div>

I placed my hands on the cold flesh. I whispered the ancient words - words that come from the depths of Hell itself. "SURGE, REVIVE, AWAKEN." They didn't rise. Not yet.
